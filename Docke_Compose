===========================================================
Explanation:

* The web service uses the latest Nginx image and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container. It also mounts the ./web-content directory from
the host to the container's web root directory to serve content.

* The db service uses the latest MySQL image. It sets environment variables for MySQL configuration and credentials. It also uses a volume named 
mysql-data to persist the MySQL data.

* Both services are connected to a custom network named mynetwork, allowing them to communicate with each other using service names as hostnames.

* Volumes are used to ensure data persistence between container restarts.
