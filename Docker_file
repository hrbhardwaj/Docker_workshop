# Docker Flie 

A Dockerfile is a plain text configuration file used to define how a Docker container image should be built. It contains a set of 
instructions that specify the base image, environment settings, software installations, file copies, and commands to run when the container
starts. Docker uses the instructions in the Dockerfile to automatically create a container image that encapsulates your application and its 
dependencies.

 Example 

 # Use an existing base image as the starting point
FROM ubuntu:20.04

 # Set environment variables (optional)
ENV APP_NAME=myapp

 # Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

 # Copy files from the host machine to the container
COPY . .
 
 # Run commands to install software or dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y software-package

 # Expose a port that the container will listen on (optional)
EXPOSE 8080

 # Specify the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


 # In this example:

 FROM:    Specifies the base image. You can use a pre-existing image from Docker Hub or a custom image you've created.
 ENV:     Sets environment variables that can be accessed by processes running in the container.
 WORKDIR: Sets the working directory inside the container where subsequent commands will be executed. And user enter thid directory 
 COPY:    Copies files from the host machine (where the Dockerfile resides) to the container.
 RUN:     Runs commands to install software, configure the environment, and set up dependencies.
 EXPOSE:  Informs Docker that the container listens on a specific port (for documentation purposes).
 CMD:     Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. This can be overridden when starting the container.

 # To build an image from a Dockerfile, you use the docker build command:

docker build -t myimage .

# Important Questions From Docker File 

Q1. Difference Between Add and Copy argument ?
Ans = Copy : It is used to Copt the file from host machine to docker container with specific directory
      ADD : It s same as like Copy the file form host machine to container It has some additional features compared to COPY, such as the ability to 
             automatically extract compressed archives and URLs.

Q2. Difference Between CMD and Entrypoint ?
Ans = Both are used for Executing the command at the time fo container deplyoment 
        CMD :   It is overide ( when bulding the container if any command will apply then CMD will not work )
        Enterypoint : It is enforced ( When building the container if anycommand will provide it will not excute )
